    <h2>Her unbeaten record at life continues...</h2>

    <p>Winning awards was never something that mattered a whole bunch to Madelyn. She was happy just doing what she
      loved. There were times where winning blue ribbons was fun, but not winning never took any of the fun away from
      what she loved to do. That is where the phrase “winning at life” came from. She always felt like she won at life
      when she was happy and having fun, there was never a need for the trophy to acknowledge that she was good at
      something. If she liked doing it, it did not matter what others thought about her skills.</p>

    <p>If a hard worker is what you are looking for then look no farther because Madelyn is as hard a worker as they
      come. Her dedication to projects and ability to make things work is unmatched. No matter how long a project might
      take, know that when you put her on the job, she will try her hardest to make sure it is done to the best of her
      ability. This attitude goes back to growing up as a Girl Scout. She was taught how to preserve and achieve her
      goals from a young age. Madelyn is a recipient of the Girl Scout’s highest award and honor, the Gold Award. She
      earned this her senior year of high school but had began working as soon as she entered high school as a freshman.
      This project is something that she holds near and dear to her heart. In completing her project she had bettered
      her high school community and learned how to interact and deal with the local department of transportation. Since
      this took years to complete and the award requires a minimum of 80 hours of service she now knows how to push
      through and find a way no matter how many times she gets shot down.</p>

    <p>Madelyn has lived in Northern Virginia her whole life and enjoys living on the east coast. Her family are avid
      travelers, and they love to take trips to experience new places and cultures. Through this she has had the
      opportunity to visit many places in the United States as well as many countries globally. Madelyn wishes to
      continue to travel as it brings so much joy. In her free time, she is a dancer, enjoys baking and cooking, reading
      an watching movies or TV shows.</p>
    <p>Madelyn Saadah is a communications student at James Madison University studying Public Relations. This is a
      subject that she is passionate about and can see herself using in the future. Throughout her schooling she has
      enjoyed learning about the Public Relations world and how to apply the practice at a national and international
      level.

      Madelyn’s work experience in public relations comes from an internship she holds through University Communications
      at JMU. The position of media relations assistant has exposed her to how a university uses their connections to
      make the news. From this internship she has learned more about how to gain earned media and how important that is
      to a company or in this case a university. There is so much more to learn from an internship than most will be
      able to get from classroom learning.
